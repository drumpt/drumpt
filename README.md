## Biography
I am a machine learning researcher at [AITRICS](http://en.aitrics.com/?redirect=no), working under the supervision of Prof. [Eunho Yang](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/people/). My research interests lie in developing scalable and provable machine learning algorithms for various applications. Currently, I am particularly intrigued by out-of-distribution generalization, deep generative models, and statistical learning theory. If you wish to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact me!
